# Find Upcoming Games

This feature allows you to see all the upcoming games in our system. Using the options at the top you can refine the search to only include games in a certain time range and or in a radius around yourself. Athletic Directors have the ability to overwrite the walrus image if they want. 

Currently the radial search function uses US zip code which get translated into a latitude and longitude. Sorry international users. I am aware of the problem and searching for a remedy.
