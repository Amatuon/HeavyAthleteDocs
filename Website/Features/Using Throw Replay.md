# How to use Throw Replay
If you haven't already first [[Setting Up Throw Replay|set up Throw Replay]].

Now that your Athlete Model is ready clicking the [[Throw Replay]] button on the [[Home Page]] should take you [here](https://heavyathlete.com/premium/wireframe_video/).

All you have to do is provide a link to a video hosted on  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/home) with the sharing link set to Anyone with the link may view. For the fastest turn around on videos please limit videos to 15 seconds or less.

When you hit submit Heavy Athlete will pass your request to our Throw Replay server named [[Penny]]. Penny will download the video from google drive, apply the wireframe to it, extract the points from the wireframe and prepare the Throw Replay model using your Athlete Model and then upload both the wireframe and the Throw Replay model to google drive. Once both files are on google drive an Email will be sent to the account you used to register for Heavy Athlete with. That email contains a link to download both the wireframed video and the Throw Replay model.

It takes time to do all of those steps. Penny was a powerful computer when she was built but its been a while. It is also my personal computer at home. Downloading and uploading the video ideally should happen faster but lets assume that it takes the same amount of time as watching the video. Wireframing the video happens at about 1/2 video speed. Generating the Throw Replay model from the wireframed video takes about a second no matter what (the start up is slow but the work is fast)
So all said and done a 15 second video should be about 61 seconds round trip from submitting on Heavy Athlete to in your inbox. While a 30 second video should be around two minutes. 
Once some money actually starts coming in from the [[Premium Features]] I will stop using Penny and start using cloud hardware which should speed things up.

If a video takes longer than that please don't resubmit the video for processing as it just slows everything down. While Throw Replay is still so new I am monitoring the system daily to flush through any videos that get stuck in the pipeline. If you don't receive your video in a timely manner [send me an email](mailto:theheavyathlete@gmail.com) and I would be happy to correct that for you.
