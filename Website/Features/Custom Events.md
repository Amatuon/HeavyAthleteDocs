# Custom Events

This is an often overlooked feature of the site. While we are the place for the highland games, the games tend to bleed into and overlap with other things. How many of you have had a 10 event while the judges are tallying scores? Sure it may not count but wouldn't you like to have a record of it? How many have done a highlander competition? What about stone lifting? Or maybe your game was at a brewery and the AD added some keg events.

ADs have the power to add *any* and I do mean *any* event to their games. For reference just check out these:
- [Festival at Fort 4 Stonelifting](https://heavyathlete.com/game/5769/)
- [Ashville Highland Games](https://heavyathlete.com/game/5641/) had a problem with the pro sheaf bag. These scores are recorded but not in rankings.
- [Breadalbane Gathering and Games](https://heavyathlete.com/game/5665/) included some keg tossing.

Any score entered into a custom event will show up for that game and only for that game. Scores entered in custom events do **not** effect rankings.
