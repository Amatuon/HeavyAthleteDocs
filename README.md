Heavy Athlete Docs Overview
====================

[Heavy Athlete](https://heavyathlete.com) is the best website for the highland games! Inspired by the short comings of [NASGA](https://www.nasgaweb.com/dbase/main.asp) and the power of [Cabermetrics](https://app.cabermetrics.com/database) Heavy Athlete is the next step for the Highland Games.

Heavy Athlete is feature complete with both NASGA and Cabermetrics. It also has new useful features for athletic directors and athletes.

Features:

- Collect / Send payments securely with Stripe
- Searching for upcoming games can be refined by time and distance to the game
- One click sending to NASGA. (NASGA is famously hard to use. Instead of breaking the ecosystem we decided to help)

Premium Features:

- Throw Replay: Send in a video and get a wireframed video and throw model back. The throw model lets you see the throw frame by frame and from any angle via our app.
- Side-by-Side: Compare multiple athletes side by side and view compare them across any statistic imaginable.
