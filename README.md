Heavy Athlete Docs Overview
====================

[Heavy Athlete](https://heavyathlete.com) is the best website for the highland games! Inspired by the short comings of [NASGA](https://www.nasgaweb.com/dbase/main.asp) and the power of [Cabermetrics](https://app.cabermetrics.com/database) Heavy Athlete is the next step for the Highland Games.

Heavy Athlete is feature complete with both NASGA and Cabermetrics. It also has new useful features for athletic directors and athletes.
