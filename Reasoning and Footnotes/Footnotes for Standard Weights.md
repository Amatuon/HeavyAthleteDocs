# Footnotes for Standard Weights

## Why only minimum weights?
Minimum weights are enforced because fundamentally a 2 pounds of weight contains 1 pound of weight it just has other stuff too.
Because 2 contains 1 I also don't care if the implement is heavier than normal due to terrain effects. Such as but not limited to:
- Mud on the implement. This only adds weight.
- Water on the implement. Whether its raining or someone threw the sheaf bag in the river on accident. This only adds weight.

## Why the strange verbiage for open stone?
The inclusion of the verbiage "or equal to" is because if by some chance you don't have a second rock you may throw the same rock for both events provided it qualifies as a Braemar.
