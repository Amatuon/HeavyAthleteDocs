# Game Finances  
  
## $50,000 version  
  
This is the first size of game that I think makes sense. (For this  
scale obviously you can run a game much cheaper.)  
  
### Game Structure  
  
This game will consist of the top 6 men and top 6 women as determined  
by scores on HeavyAthlete.com [Update with link to tracking page when done] 

All nine events will be contested for both men and women. Men's sheaf  
will be 20 lbs. Women's sheaf will be 10 lbs.  
  
A secret tenth event is planned to help balance the schedule.  
  
The competition will take pace over two days. (Saturday and Sunday)  
  
Athletes will be expected to show up on Friday. The purpose of this is  
record interviews and record promotional material mainly focused on  
the athletes themselves. My intention is to release this as production  
like Worlds Strongest Man so we need to generate interviews and  
backstory stuff.  

The game will have an accompanying festival. Details to come. 

The whole game will recorded and edited into a show for distribution.
  
### Prize Pool  
  
Total value $30,000 + WR Breaks  
  
The prize payouts for men and women will be identical minus any WR  
payouts, more on that below. As such the prize pool for men will be  
$15,000 and for women will also be $15,000.  
#### Men's / Women's Pool  

The $15,000 will first be split into $6,000 and $9,000.  
  
The $6,000 covers the travel stipend for all competitors. That means each  
athlete has a total travel stipend of $1,000.  
  
Now the more interesting $9,000 is for event placings. With all 9  
events contested that means there is $1,000 per event (no event is  
more important than the others).  
  
First Caber is not worth the headache of dividing the payment based on  
placing. So Caber is winner take all. In the event that there is a  
perfect tie (hopefully two athletes with 3 perfect 12:00) there will  
be a shoot out between the tied athletes both will throw and first to  
score worse loses.  
  
Every other standard event has the same payout structure. $1,000 per event  
divided as follows: First place $500, Second place $250, Third place  
$125, Fourth place $75, Fifth place $50, Last place $0. This structure  
is not to punish last place. If you are among the top 6 in the world  
you are clearly exceptional. Instead its to provide incentive to  
everyone to throw their best at every event. I think most will agree  
that its worth it to put in a bit of extra effort when tired when it  
could mean being handed $50.  

The secret event will be sponsored by Heavy Athlete with the prize not following the normal payout scheme.

#### World Records  
  
We will be working with sponsors for each event. Sponsorship costs  
$1,000 per event with details below. Sponsors will additionally be the  
ones covering prize support for world record breaks. The prize for  
breaking a world record is $1,000. This prize is available to both the  
men and women's groups. So interested sponsors take note. Minimally  
you are handing me $1,000 to have me mention you in the style of "The  
braemar stone brought to you by Heavy Athlete" in all recorded media  
of the game and display your logo during the recorded videos. You are  
also on the hook for up to $2,000 more if both the men's and women's  
record are broken. Hopefully you can see the additional value of  
having your name attached to all media of the world record throw.  
  
Caber is exempt from these World Record payouts as that doesn't make sense.  

### Sponsorship

Heavy Athlete is dedicated to promoting the Heavy Events of the Scottish Highland games. There are many ways that other companies can show their support. First and foremost you can sponsor an event. Sponsoring an event costs between $1,000 and $3,000. The sponsorship of an event itself costs $1,000 and means that your logo will be visible just before or immediately after the event during the main video recording. Additionally during all highlight reels that Heavy Athlete cuts together and releases we will refer to the sponsor in the style of "Caber brought to you by Heavy Athlete." The additional cost is a risk that the sponsor takes on in the form of up to two $1,000 payments to the athlete who breaks the world record for their class in your sponsored event. (Only one $1,000 payment per athlete per event but you can't sponsor Women's Sheaf and not Men's Sheaf or visa versa.) This and other forms of sponsorship may be negotiated by contacting theheavyathlete@gmail.com

#### Example Payouts  
  
##### Dominant performance with no new world records  
$1,000 (travel stipend) + $1,000 (caber win) + 8 x ($500 (first  
place)) = $6,000 (total)  
  
##### Lose literally every event  
$1,000 (travel stipend) = $1,000 (total)  
  
Add $1,000 for each world record broken to the total.

### Additional Expenses (Predicted)

#### Judges:
4 Judges paid at a rate of $200 a day.
I expect that need Judges only for Saturday and Sunday of the game. Implying two days of work or $400 per judge.
Total Judges: $1,600

#### Shirts:
I'm giving each judge 3 branded shirts. 3 x 4 = 12 shirts

Each athlete is going to get 5 t-shirts and 3 collared shirts all branded. 12 Athletes x 8 shirts = 96 shirts

I need 3 branded shirts.

Total Shirts (count): 111
Estimated Amortized Shirt Cost: $20 per shirt
Total Shirts: $2,220

#### Rooms:

4 Judges x 3 nights = 12 nights
12 Athletes x 3 nights = 36 nights
1 Me x 3 nights = 3 nights

Total Nights (count): 51
Estimated cost of a night: $100 - $150 (time and location obviously matter a lot here)
Total Nights: $5,100 - $7,650

#### Totals:
Judging: $1,600
Shirts: $2,220
Lodging: $7,650

Subtotal: $11,470
Available Funds: $20,000 (based on a $50,000 game with a $30,000 prize purse)

Slush Fund to cover EVERYTHING else: $8,530

That's enough floating capital that if needed I can hire another judge / shagger and cover half the potential world record breaks without sponsor support. Obviously there are a lot more things required for what we are trying to pull off. I'm going to need a camera and video team minimally. And I haven't even revealed the [secret plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) yet.

### Final Thoughts

In the initial [video announcement of this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWw9sMk9p-k) I mention two important facts.
