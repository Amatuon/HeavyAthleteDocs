Traditional order is the order in which we display scores on the site.  [[Sheaf]] was added to the games much later and isn't at the end so you can debate how "traditional" traditional is. That doesn't really matter though when people say that the events are happening in traditional order this is what they mean.

- [[Heavy Hammer]]

There is nothing wrong with not throwing in traditional order. This is the order that the premier [[Flights|flight]] of the day will typically throw in but even then exceptions occur. If rain is likely then often times the sheaf moves forward so that the bag doesn't get wet. Caber moves around a lot. Athletic Directors often like to have caber thrown when the largest crowd is gathered since to spectators it is one of the more visually impressive events. If the game is large enough to have multiple flights don't be surprised if you don't go in traditional order. Running multiple events in parallel keeps the day moving and the crowd engaged.
