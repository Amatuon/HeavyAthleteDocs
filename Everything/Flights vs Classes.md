[[Flights]] and [[Classes]] are in fact used synonymously basically everywhere. Heavy Athlete is bucking that trend because there are two related but different concepts here. 

Flights only exists on game day. This is the group that you throw with. By default it is the same as a class but can be tweaked. Use Cases: 
- You have multiple classes throwing at the same time and want to represent that but also want their scores to remain separate for rankings. eg. Amateur B and C throw at the same time but get different rewards. Or a pro / am team comp. One of these happened in Florida where a pro was teamed with an am as a mentoring sort of thing.
- Teams. Teams work great with flights because you have total freedom want to mix pro and am? Do it! Men and Women? Do it! Masters and Kids? Do it! 
- Judges and Volunteers. A lot of people have asked If they can credit there judges and volunteers on the site and you can. Just make a flight called judges or volunteer and toss that person in it. If you don't give them any event scores only their name will show up and under their profile they will have a link to the game like any other game.

Classes exist for [[Rankings]]. The pros aren't in the same pond with the ams and the men aren't in the same pond as the women. Classes should tell you a little about the biology of the athlete (sex and age) and more importantly which implements they threw. At Heavy Athlete we don't discriminate (we hate everyone equally) so honestly classes are more for athletes to compare themselves to each other. What we do care about is the implements thrown the pro sheaf is 20 lbs and while the am is 16 lbs. There are other [[Standard Weights]] but those implement differences are why we have different classes. 

So as an AD you can modify both. In general the only change you may have to make to a class is moving someone from lightweight to not lightweight if they weigh in over on game day. Flights the world is your oyster you never have to interact with flights if you don't want but it can make your game results cleaner to look at on the site.
