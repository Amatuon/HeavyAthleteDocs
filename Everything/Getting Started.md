# Welcome to Heavy Athlete

We are your one stop shop for all things highland games. This page contains information about the site in general. If you want a quick start guide for athletes [[Quick Start Athlete|click here]]. Or if you want a quick start for directors [[Quick Start Director|click here]]. 

In order to get the most use out of Heavy athlete we suggest [signing up](https://heavyathlete.com/auth/login/) it is free and we don't sell your data. 

Starting on our [[Home Page]] you can find a number of useful features:
- First is our [[Partners]] link. We ask that you take a moment to follow it and look at everyone that has contributed to us. There are even some coupon codes on the page to make it worth your while.
- Next you have our [[Upcoming Games]] section. You can use this to view all upcoming games using our [[Games Calendar]] or filter for a specific one using our [[Find Game Not Implemented]] feature
- Then we come the the [[Results]] section. Here you can jump to any [[Game Page]] or [[Athlete Page]] that has results for your selected year. While this is a perfectly viable way to move around the site we recommend our [[Navbar]] feature instead.
- Next comes the [[Rankings]] section. This will let you view all athletes in a class with results for a given year. 
- Finally is our [[Community]] section. There is a link to [Email us](mailto:theheavyathlete@gmail.com) and to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/76C2WeTV9B) 

The home page is just the first step a launching point into the rest of the site. We recommend clicking some links to learn more about what you are interested in.
