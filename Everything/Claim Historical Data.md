Historic Data is data that has been imported into Heavy Athlete from another source and therefore is incomplete. Other systems don't have athlete gender and age stored which limits their capabilities to sort athlete data. To find and claim any historic data that should be associated with your account just use the search bar. A small window displaying the data should render on the page. When you are satisfied that the data is correct click the button that says "Add this Historic Data". To release claimed data click the button that says "Remove this Historic Data". 

Claiming historic data removes the Historic Athlete from the search bar so that no one else can claim that data. This is so that your scores can belong only to you. This does allow for people to cheat the system and steal glory. Any cases of this have been resolved swiftly. Repeat offenders will be banned from the site.
