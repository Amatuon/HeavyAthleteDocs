# Standard Weights for Implements

## Heavy Athlete's Weight Matrix

|               | Pro Men | Amateur Men | Pro / Amateur Women |
| :------------ | :-----: | :---------: | :-----------------: |
| Braemar Stone |   20    | Same as Pro |         13          |
| Open Stone    |   16    | Same as Pro |          8          |
| Heavy Weight  |   56    | Same as Pro |         28          |
| Light Weight  |   28    | Same as Pro |         14          |
| Heavy Hammer  |   22    | Same as Pro |         16          |
| Light Hammer  |   16    | Same as Pro |         12          |
| Sheaf         |   20    |     16      |         12          |
| WOB           |   56    | Same as Pro |         28          |
Weights are reported in pounds.
All weights listed are the **minimum** weight allowed for the implement. 
Minimum weights are enforced because fundamentally a 2 pounds of weight contains 1 pound of weight it just has other stuff too.
Because 2 contains 1 I also don't care if the implement is heavier than normal due to terrain effects. Such as but not limited to:
- Mud on the implement. This only adds weight.
- Water on the implement. Whether its raining or someone threw the sheaf bag in the river on accident. This only adds weight.
The only implement with a maximum weight is the open stone. It must be less than or equal to the weight of the Braemar stone used by that class at that game.
The inclusion of the verbiage "or equal to" is because if by some chance you don't have a second rock you may throw the same rock for both events provided it qualifies as a Braemar.

Note: Hey Matt can we make shotputs official open stones here? I'm for it. Although I may mention it under legal lengths and whatnot.

## Other Peoples' Weight Matrices
Note: I have added critiques to most / all of these. I think that all of these are excellent and think highly of the people who took the time to write all this down but there are inconsistencies in every single one. Additionally basically none of them agree with each other on everything which is why we have constructed our own.
### [NASGA](http://www.nasgaweb.com/main.asp)

Critiques:
- Technically it would be possible for men to throw a heavier open stone than Braemar. I think this should be disallowed. Braemar should always be heavier than open. With this addendum I think the ranges are fine.
- Instead of the x or y weights for masters and amateur men a lot of headache on my end could have been spared if they had simply listed them as x+ instead. I think that this is the start of that trend.

Critiques: 
- Its strange that Amateur Men can only throw the 16 and not the 20 in sheaf while Pro Men, it seems, have the option to throw the 16 or the 20 but 20 is preferred.

Critiques: 
- Technically it would be possible for men to throw a heavier open stone than Braemar. I think this should be disallowed. Braemar should always be heavier than open. With this addendum I think the ranges are fine.
- I don't think SHAG forces women and masters to actually throw the 56 pound for WOB but it is what the site says.
- Strange to include Novice for a single event and match them to Masters without matching elsewhere

Note: This is a Masters organization so they only list masters weights. They are also partnered with Heavy Athlete so their weight matrix got particular favor when creating our own.
Critiques:
- This data was pulled from their contested events page and Sheaf is absent. They in fact have records for Sheaf and list the 16 for all men's categories and 10 for all women's categories except for women 80+ which has no sheaf record.

Note: This is an adaptive organization so they only list adaptive weights. They are also partnered with Heavy Athlete so their weight matrix got particular favor when creating our own.
Critiques: 
- For some categories the acceptable ranges for stones mean that technically it would be possible to throw a heavier open stone than Braemar. I think this should be disallowed. Braemar should always be heavier than open. With this addendum I think the ranges are fine.
- For adaptive athletes in the Upper Limb Loss category they recommend only using one hammer for safety concerns. I find this to be totally reasonable. However I am unsure about how to report this for rankings. Should I merge Heavy and Light Hammer scores for athletes in this class to make it easier for ADs to enter? Should I overwrite what gets displayed to the screen for pages with this class or just report what the ADs enter? That second option is a large can of worms and if avoidable I would like to avoid that option. Under the women's category the event is referred to as heavy hammer and that has my vote for how scores should be entered and reported.
