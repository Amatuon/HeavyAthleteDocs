# The man behind the curtain

Hi there I'm Michael McDougal and I am the owner, CEO, and sole member of Dark Stranger LLC. Obviously we are not a big company seeing as I'm the only employee but Heavy Athlete is produced by this company. The reason its produced by Dark Stranger LLC and not just Michael McDougal is that if you have a problem with my product you can only go after the company assets not my personal assets. 

Many people ask about the name. If you know a little bit of Gaelic it makes perfect sense. McDougal is the Americanization of MacDougall. Mac means son of, Dou means dark or secret or mysterious, and Gall means stranger. So my last name is literally son of a dark stranger. I thought that was pretty cool so I decided to embrace it for my company name.

Notable products worked on by Dark Stranger LLC include:
[Heavy Athlete](https://heavyathlete.com): You are literally in the docs for this one
[ChemStud](https://chemstud.com): An app that can solve collegiate freshman level chemistry
