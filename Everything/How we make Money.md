# Monetization on Heavy Athlete

Heavy Athlete is owned by [[Dark Stranger LLC]]. And seeing as we are a business we need to make money. There are several ways that we monetize the site.
1. First we collect a fee when you sign up for a game. When an AD sets a price which an athlete pays they don't get the full amount. Heavy Athlete tries to reserve 5% of the transaction as app fees. 2.9% + $0.30 goes to [[Stripe]] our payment processor. For small values that 30 cents can add up to a large percentage. For payments less that $14.29 the app fee must be larger than 5% because of that 30 cents. If the payment is above $14.29 then the total app fee is 5%. Stripe gets their cut and Heavy Athlete keeps the rest. See table below for details. This fee is designed so that at with our current projections we should make 2x our server costs in a year. The thought being that we can literally double our operational cost without imposing additional strain on directors. This however is not a lot of money hence the additional monetization strategies.

| What the Athlete pays | What Stripe collects | What Heavy Athlete collects | What the AD collects |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 |
| $10.00 | $0.59 | $0.00 | $9.41 |
| $15.00 | $0.73 | $0.02 | $14.25 |
| $25.00 | $1.02 | $0.23 | $23.75 |
| $50.00 | $1.75 | $0.75 | $47.50 |
| $100.00 | $3.20 | $1.80 | $95.00 |

2. Second we collect donations. _Deprecated_ If you visit our [[Sponsors]] you'll see an option at the bottom to the [[Donation Page]]. _this was a violation of stripes policies so it has been discontinued_
3. Third we have our premium membership. Get access to Throw Replay, Side-by-Side and more!
4. Finally we sell things. This feature is still work in progress and therefore unavailable.
