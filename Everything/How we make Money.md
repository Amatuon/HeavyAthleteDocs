# Monetization on Heavy Athlete

Heavy Athlete, owned by [[Dark Stranger LLC]], employs several strategies to generate revenue and sustain its operations. Here's an overview of our monetization methods:

## 1. Transaction Fees

We collect a fee when you sign up for a game. This fee is split between Heavy Athlete and our payment processor, [[Stripe]].

### Fee Breakdown:
- Heavy Athlete aims to reserve 5% of the transaction
- Stripe charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

### Fee Structure:
- For payments less than $14.29: App fee > 5% due to Stripe's $0.30 fixed fee
- For payments $14.29 and above: Total app fee = 5%

This structure is designed to cover our server costs with a 2x buffer for potential growth.
