From here you can get basically anywhere on the site. At the top you will find a link to the [[Find Upcoming Game]] page. If you are looking to sign up for a game this is the tool for you. The next section is either an advertisement for our [[Premium Features]]. Or if you have bought access to our premium features then this section contains links to most of the upgrades. Under that three sections are grouped together. [[Games Calendar]], [[Rankings]], and a link to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/76C2WeTV9B). The calendar has a list of all games in the system sorted by date, making it convenient for finding historic games. Rankings are sorted by class and year. Compare athletes against each other and see who's on top. Next we have our featured [[Partners|partner]]. Every time you visit one is chosen at random to be featured. These groups support Heavy Athlete and Heavy Athlete supports them. Consider purchasing something from the ones who sell things to support the site. If you are viewing on desktop then next to the partner is a [[Game Page|Game]] search feature and an [[Athlete Page|Athlete]] search feature. If you are on mobile these will appear under the partner section. Both of these function like the search bar in the [[Navbar]] but are limited to only their respective types. Below those is a section leading you to the [[Getting Started]] guide and by extension the rest of the documentation. Down in the footer are a lot of links that are self explanatory.
