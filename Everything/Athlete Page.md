Every athlete in the system has an athlete page. If you want to show off your accomplishments, or spy on the competition this is the page.

The top of each page will display the athlete's name so you know who your looking at.

Next is a custom bio. Each athlete has the ability to write a little bit about themselves here. The data here gets compiled with other athletes in the game and is available to [[Director Page| Game Directors]] under the [[Game Dashboard]] for any game that the athlete has a score for. The purpose of this feature is to let you brag about yourself but also to give that data to the directors. We hope that directors reference the convenient cheat sheet we compile about all athletes to talk about you during games. eg. [Matthew McDougal](https://heavyathlete.com/athlete/2/) is the owner of [The Barn Gym](https://www.thebarngymva.com/) in VA and a host of the [Goin' Rogue](https://linktr.ee/goin_rogue_podcast) podcast. He is a professional Mas wrestler, Arm wrestler, and most importantly Highland Games athlete. etc... blah blah blah you get the picture. By arming the game directors with more info about you we hope to make the games or interesting for spectators. You may have noticed that in the example there are functioning links. The bio section is a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) compatible box so that you can insert links and photos to your hearts content (within the law I swear to God if some dumb ass uses this to distribute child porn I'm handing you over to the law so fast it will make you dizzy). Feel free to use this section and the linking features of markdown to promote your Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, business etc... So long as its legal we really don't care.

Next you have a year selector which will update the scores section below it. Years only appear that we have scores for an athlete during. There is also the Best Overall option which shows the sum of bests for the athlete across all time and the sum of bests for each year.

If you are signed in and are viewing your own page you have an [[Update Profile]] link which allows you to accomplish various tasks.

If an athlete is linked to a game director account then a link to the relevant director page is also available after their scores.
