[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is an awesome tool for taking notes. The documentation for heavy athlete is written in obsidian and exported using the awesome plugin [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export/blob/master/README.md). The result is the page you see before you now. If you are interested in trying obsidian I recommend it. Everything is stored as markdown which is recurring theme on heavy athlete so if you are going to learn it anyway might as well make the most of it. Obsidian is free for personal use and for commercial use if you have a company of one. Fortunately [[Dark Stranger LLC]]. (the parent company for HeavyAthlete.com) is a single dude. I love this program and wish to share it with all of you. This is not paid advertisement I'm pretty sure obsidian doesn't know I exist, I just want to share this awesome tech with everyone.
