### What is Throw Replay?

Throw Replay is an innovative service that turns your throwing videos into detailed, interactive 3D models. Here's what you get:

1. **Wireframed Video**: A precise, visual breakdown of your throw.
2. **3D Model**: An interactive representation of your throw, viewable from any angle.

### How It Works (Without Giving Away All Our Secrets)

1. **Powerful Wireframe Generation**: We create a detailed wireframe representation of you, tracking your position throughout the throw.

2. **Athlete Model Integration**: Using your personalized [[Setting Up Throw Replay|Athlete Model]], we translate your throw from video to our custom app, ensuring accuracy tailored to your unique physique.

3. **Deep Analysis**: Our system processes your throw, currently taking about 3 times the length of your video. (Pro tip: Trim your videos to include only the actual throw for faster processing!)

### Why Throw Replay is a Game-Changer

- **Form Correction**: Identify and correct form issues with unprecedented precision.
- **Progress Tracking**: Compare throws over time to see your improvement.
