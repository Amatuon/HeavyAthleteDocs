# The Heavy Athlete Motto

Our motto here at [HeavyAthlete.com](https://heavyathlete.com) is "Learn, Compete, Celebrate".

Learn:
- You are here in the docs so you are already learning.
- We have numerous resources here for learning about the games and how to hone your craft.
- We are partnering with coaches to help provide you with the best conditions to grow your knowledge and craft.
- This connects us a community with the best of us passing on their experiences.

Compete:
- Sign up for a game.
- This is why we are all here, the actual games.
- This is our community time when we gather. We reaffirm our bonds and push each other to become better.

Celebrate:
- Look at your placement in Rankings. Every score is based of a percentage of the world record. Every PR brings you closer
- Look at your athlete page. Track your progress and growth over time.
- Look at the games pages. If you are signed in you have the option to instantly see every throw that was a PR or SB for every athlete.
- The reason we have to celebrate so hard is, at the first game I ever attended [Wes Kiser](https://heavyathlete.com/athlete/nasga4044/) said, "Celebrate every PR, because one day they stop."
