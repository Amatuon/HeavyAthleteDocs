# Kilts: Traditional Scottish Attire

A kilt is a traditional, pleated skirt-like garment worn primarily by men in Scotland. The traditional kilt's design incorporates a heavy woolen fabric, typically featuring a **tartan** pattern. It is wrapped around the body and secured with a belt.

## History

The origins of the kilt date back to the 16th century. Initially, kilts were worn in a different form called the "great kilt" or "belted plaid." The modern kilt, known as the "little kilt" or "walking kilt," emerged in the early 18th century. Following the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the British government banned the wearing of Highland dress, including kilts, through the Dress Act of 1746. However, this ban was repealed in 1782, and kilts were later popularized during the Romantic period as a symbol of Scottish heritage.

## Length and Design

Traditional kilts are typically made from about 8 yards (7.3 m) of fabric for an average-sized man, with some variations based on the wearer's size and the desired fullness of the pleats. The pleats and the way the fabric is wrapped around the body allow for ample movement and flexibility.

## Tartans

Each kilt's tartan represents a specific clan, family, region, or organization in Scotland. Tartans consist of interwoven horizontal and vertical stripes in various colors. The design and arrangement of these bands are unique to each tartan.

Contrary to popular belief, tartans were not originally used to distinguish clans during battles. The association of specific tartans with particular clans or families largely developed in the 19th century. Historically, tartans were more closely associated with regions rather than specific clans, as the availability of certain dyes influenced local color preferences.

Today, kilts serve not only as traditional attire but also as a symbol of Scottish heritage, with each tartan representing its respective clan, family, region, or organization.

## Kilts at Highland Games

Kilts are an essential part of traditional dress at Highland Games. While it's not usually mandatory for spectators to wear kilts, they are typically required for competitors. Here's why:

1. **Cultural Significance**: Wearing a kilt at Highland Games honors Scottish heritage and traditions. It creates a strong visual connection to Scotland's past and helps maintain cultural identity.
2. **Ceremonial Purposes**: Many Highland Games include parades or opening ceremonies where participants wearing kilts create a striking visual display, enhancing the event's authenticity and atmosphere.
3. **Community and Camaraderie**: Wearing kilts at these events fosters a sense of community among participants and spectators, creating a shared experience and connection to Scottish culture.

At the end of the day if you aren't in a kilt your just throwing things in a field. If you are wearing a kilt on lookers know you are engaged with something Scottish even if they don't know what.
