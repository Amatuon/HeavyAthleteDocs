| :------------ | :-----: | :---------: | :-----------------: |
| Braemar Stone |   20    | Same as Pro |         12          |
| Open Stone    |   16    | Same as Pro |          8          |

| WOB           |   56    | Same as Pro |         28          |
Weights are reported in pounds.
Notes:
1. All weights listed are the **minimum** weight allowed for the implement. 
2. The only implement with a maximum weight is the open stone. It must be less than or equal to the weight of the Braemar stone used by that class at that game.

Note: Hey Matt can we make shotputs official open stones here? I'm for it. Although I may mention it under legal lengths and whatnot.

## Heavy Athlete's Weight Matrix for Unlisted Classes

If your class isn't covered by one of the tables above it is probably because you are a sub class of one of the above. For example I know everyone just says "Lightweights" but the name of the class is "Lightweight Amateur Men". Therefore use the Amateur Men weight matrix.

A few other exceptions:
1. Juniors: 
	- I haven't added support for a Junior class. [[Why no Junior Class|Review my reasoning]]
	- For now I would say they should use the Amateur matrix for their gender.
	- This effectively makes them a [[Flights|flight]] not a [[Classes|class]].
	- If as an AD you choose to use a different weight matrix for Juniors, enter the results as [[Custom Events|custom events]]. This will allow the scores to recorded without polluting the main rankings.
2. Novice:
	- This is probably contentious but I don't think Novice is a real class.
	- Heavy Athlete's [[Motto|motto]] is literally, "Learn, Compete, Celebrate". I believe novices have self admitted to being exclusively in the learning stage.
	- Once you compete I think you do so "for the love of thing" which by definition makes you an amateur. 
	- Keeping track of everyone's first? first five? first how many? games as a separate class seems foolish.
	- Without strict rules, people would be able to drop down to novice just to chase glory.
	- The last thing to think about is what if a Olympian comes to our sport and competes for the first time as a pro? Do you want me to list him as Novice Pro. I won't do that.
	- In conclusion. Treat novices like rookies and take them under your wing. Help them learn, watch them compete and celebrate their accomplishments. But let them be amateurs while you do. 

## Other Organizations' Weight Matrices
Note: I have added critiques to most / all of these. I think that all of these are excellent and think highly of the people who took the time to write all this down but there are inconsistencies in every single one. Additionally basically none of them agree with each other on everything which is why we have constructed our own.

Critiques:
- Technically it would be possible for men to throw a heavier open stone than Braemar. I think this should be disallowed. Braemar should always be heavier than open. With this addendum I think the ranges are fine.
- Instead of the x or y weights for masters and amateur men a lot of headache on my end could have been spared if they had simply listed them as x+ instead. I think that this is the start of that trend.

Critiques: 
- Its strange that Amateur Men can only throw the 16 and not the 20 in sheaf while Pro Men, it seems, have the option to throw the 16 or the 20 but 20 is preferred.

Critiques: 
- Technically it would be possible for men to throw a heavier open stone than Braemar. I think this should be disallowed. Braemar should always be heavier than open. With this addendum I think the ranges are fine.
- I don't think SHAG forces women and masters to actually throw the 56 pound for WOB but it is what the site says.
- Strange to include Novice for a single event and match them to Masters without matching elsewhere

Note: This is a Masters organization so they only list masters weights. They are also partnered with Heavy Athlete so their weight matrix got particular favor when creating our own.
Critiques:
- This data was pulled from their contested events page and Sheaf is absent. They in fact have records for Sheaf and list the 16 for all men's categories and 10 for all women's categories except for women 80+ which has no sheaf record.

Note: This is an adaptive organization so they only list adaptive weights. They are also partnered with Heavy Athlete so their weight matrix got particular favor when creating our own.
Critiques: 
- For some categories the acceptable ranges for stones mean that technically it would be possible to throw a heavier open stone than Braemar. I think this should be disallowed. Braemar should always be heavier than open. With this addendum I think the ranges are fine.
- For adaptive athletes in the Upper Limb Loss category they recommend only using one hammer for safety concerns. I find this to be totally reasonable. However I am unsure about how to report this for rankings. Should I merge Heavy and Light Hammer scores for athletes in this class to make it easier for ADs to enter? Should I overwrite what gets displayed to the screen for pages with this class or just report what the ADs enter? That second option is a large can of worms and if avoidable I would like to avoid that option. Under the women's category both hammers are listed anyway. What do I do about that?
