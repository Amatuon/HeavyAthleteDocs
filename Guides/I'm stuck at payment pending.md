# Help I'm stuck at Payment Pending!

## How did I get here?

You enter the payment pending state when you leave Heavy Athlete and move to [[Stripe]] when [[Sign Up For Game|signing up for a game]]. We save your [[Waivers|waiver]] signature, t-shirt size and selected class while we wait for Stripe to send us a payment confirmation. If you pay with a credit card this should happen before you are even redirected to Heavy Athlete.

## Is it okay to stay in payment pending?

Heavy Athlete has no issues with people hanging out in payment pending as it is a normal part of the signup process. ADs tend to hate it though. The AD can see everyone in the payment pending group would really like you to finish signing up. You are not reserving your spot in the game by sitting here.

## How do I remove myself from payment pending?

Navigate to the game in question and scroll to the very bottom of the page. You should see yourself. Click the appropriate link and **READ** all the instructions on the page it takes you to. If you have not paid on Stripe yet it is fine to remove yourself. If you have paid and the payment hasn't completed yet **DO NOT** remove yourself from the game. As the site admin I can check your payment status on Stripe and help resolve any issues, but this is painfully manual. You usually don't need to confirm your payment status as you already know if you paid or not. 

## But I'm in payment pending to hold my spot I'll pay later.

That's not how this works. I don't know who told you that or why you think that. I literally wrote the code for this and that feature is not available. Until you have been flagged as paid you are **NOT** signed up for a game. Your scores do **NOT** matter and the ADs **DO** get frustrated at this. The only way this excuse is valid is if you have already paid the money simply hasn't arrived yet that is the entire reason for this state.
