# Understanding and Claiming Historic Data

## What is Historic Data?
Historic Data refers to athlete information imported into Heavy Athlete from other sources. This data is often incomplete, lacking details such as athlete gender and age, which limits our ability to  sort and display it.

## How to Claim Your Historic Data

1. Navigate to [Update History](https://heavyathlete.com/auth/link_historic_data/).
2. Use the search bar to find your historic data.
3. Review the data in the small window that appears.
4. If correct, click "Add this Historic Data" to claim it.

## Removing Claimed Data
If you need to remove claimed data, simply click "Remove this Historic Data".

## Important Notes

- Claiming data removes it from the search bar, preventing others from claiming it.
- This ensures your scores belong only to you.
- The system relies on honesty. Misuse (e.g., claiming others' data) will be addressed:
  - Cases of misuse are resolved quickly.
  - Repeat offenders will be banned from the site.
