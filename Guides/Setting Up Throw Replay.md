# Setting up an Athlete Model in Throw Replay
The [[Throw Replay]] is one of our [[Premium Features]] to use it first [purchase premium access](https://heavyathlete.com/premium/signup/). 

The Throw Replay system needs a model of your proportions to more accurately generate the final model. In particular we need to know the length from one shoulder to the other. To make life simple for all of us this can be done from a photo if you provide 2 additional data points. 

First snap a photo of yourself in the mirror or have someone else snap the photo for you. You need to hold something across your chest of known length. This object can be anything but rulers and books make great options. Ideally the straight edge of the object should be in line with your heart and parallel to the x-axis of the photo. Make sure you hold the object against your body not in front of you like a mugshot. See example below.

This photo will work fine for our purposes but we need to get a little more data to help the Throw Replay system. We need the length of the object (use a ruler to figure this one out) and the length of the object in pixels. To get the pixel length open basically any image editing software and draw a selection box around the straight edge. Make sure the edge of your selection box lines up with the edge of your object. See example below.

As you can see I could have done a better job of holding the object straight. this is why having someone else take the photo is helpful. Notice in the bottom right the 600 x 88? That's the size of the selection box I drew. The number 600 is the length in pixels of my object in this photo. This number is unique to the distance you held the camera away from the subject when the photo was taken so don't just copy my work and do this for yourself. 

Now that we know the dimensions we need to give all this data to the Throw Replay system.
Head to the [athlete model update page](https://heavyathlete.com/premium/athlete_model/).
One this page there are three things you need to give the model:
1. The link to the image
2. The length of the object in inches
3. The length of the object in pixels

To share the image upload it to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/home). Right click it and set its sharing options to Anyone with the link can view. Copy that link and paste it into the proper box on Heavy Athlete. This process will likely be streamlined in the future. Sorry for the inconvenience but its to keep the site running smoothly on the low end hardware it runs on. 

To determine the length use a ruler or tape measure. Make sure you measure the same edge that you measured in pixels.

To determine the length in pixels reference the process above.

With these three bits of data in hit the Submit Button,

After a few moments your model will be complete and you will be ready to use the Throw Replay system. 

To send it a video for processing use this [link](https://heavyathlete.com/premium/wireframe_video/). If it takes you back to the Athlete Model Page it means that your model is not yet ready and you should try the link again in a few minutes

Once that link takes you to Video Submission page then continue with [[Using Throw Replay]].
