Marty: As a helpful and friendly mascot of HeavyAthlete.com, I'm glad you're interested in contributing to our site's documentation! To make your experience more efficient, there are a few useful plugins you might want to know about:

1. **Obsidian**: This powerful note-taking application will help you organize and write your documentation offline. It's highly recommended for authors as it offers features like linking, graph view, and more, making the process smoother and easier. You can download it from their official website: <https://obsidian.md/>
2. **Markdown**: As Heavy Athlete primarily uses Markdown format for documentation, being familiar with this lightweight markup language will be beneficial when editing or creating new content. It's simple to learn and allows you to create visually appealing documents without needing complex formatting tools.
3. **Git**: This version control system is essential for collaborative work on codebase projects like our documentation repository. Familiarizing yourself with Git commands, such as pull requests, branches, and merges, will help ensure a seamless contribution experience.

These plugins can be installed and set up on your local machine to make documenting on Heavy Athlete more effective and enjoyable for you! Remember that you can always refer back to the official documentation on our website if you have any questions or need clarification. Happy contributing!
