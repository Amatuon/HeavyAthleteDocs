When do you sync data with other sources?
This question has many answers.
Because Data Synchronization is slow and error prone we try to synchronize only small amounts of data at a time. 
1. We push data to other sources only when an athletic director requests it. No need to do work if no one wants us to.
2. We pull games daily. Games pulled this way must have occurred either last month or this month and must be new to us.
3. We pull games weekly. Since the daily pull can easily miss data if an AD enters half the scores on Monday then the rest on Wednesday, we pull all games in the last month and this month every week regardless of if we have them in our system or not.
4. We pull games monthly. The previous systems still miss games that happen outside our time window. Yes people routinely edit games from 10 years ago and I don't know why either. Our monthly pull is a total database refresh.
5. We can pull whenever we want. There is an admin tool that will trigger any of the types of pull with the click of a button.

If something has gone wrong and you think that our scores are out of sync. The first thing to do is wait. 90% of the time errors get sorted out automatically when additional pulls are run. If its been awhile with no fix, or the data transfer is time sensitive, send us an [email](mailto:theheavyathlete@gmail.com) and we will run our commands to flush the system.
